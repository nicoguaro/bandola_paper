  abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid holographic-numerical method for modal
	analysis of complex structures. A continuous structure is first lumped
	into a number of discrete elements to form an elastically connected
	lumped linear system. The matrix of influence coefficients of the
	lumped linear system are then determined by exerting a static load
	to the element centers and measuring the corresponding whole-field
	displacement using digital holographic interferometry. The eigenvalues
	and eigenvectors of the influence coefficients, which in a physical
	sense represent the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the structure,
	are then calculated using the numerical method. A major advantage
	of the proposed hybrid method is that it is not necessary to know
	the Young's modulus, the Poisson's ratio of the material and the
	boundary conditions, as the displacement field measured by the optical
	method has automatically reflected the real boundary conditions and
	the material properties, which makes this method particularly useful
	for studying objects made from anisotropic materials such as composites.
	Another advantage of the proposed method is that structures of any
	complex and irregular shape will not increase the complexity of the
	characterization process. The proposed is also suitable for experimentally
	validating the modal analysis results from finite element method

  abstract = {Most theoretical studies of bowed-string instruments deal with isolated
	strings, pinned on fixed supports. In others, the instrument body
	dynamics have been accounted by using extremely simplified models
	of the string?body interaction through the instrument bridge. Such
	models have, nevertheless, been instrumental to the understanding
	of a very common and musically undesirable phenomenon known as the
	wolf note¡½a strong beating interplay between string and body vibrations.
	Cellos, bad and good, are particularly prone to this problem.
	
	
	In previous work, a computational method that allows efficient time-domain
	modelling of bowed strings based on a modal approach has been introduced.
	This has been extended to incorporate the complex dynamics of real-life
	instrument bodies, and their coupling to the string motions, using
	experimental dynamical body data. The string is modelled using its
	unconstrained modes, assuming pinned?pinned boundary conditions at
	the tailpiece and the nut. At the intermediary bridge location, the
	string?body coupling is enforced using the body impulse-response
	or modal data, as measured at the instrument bridge.
	
	
	In the present paper, this computational approach is applied to a
	specific cello, which provided experimental wolf-behaviour data under
	several bowing conditions, as well as laboratory measurements of
	the bridge impulse responses on which the numerical simulations were
	based. Interesting aspects of the string?body dynamical responses
	are highlighted by numerical simulations and the corresponding sounds
	and animations produced. Finally, a qualitative (and, when possible,
	quantitative) comparison of the experimental and numerical results
	is presented.},

  pages = {231-244},
  abstract = {There have been many attempts to understand the coupling phenomena
	between a solid structure and the surrounding fluid. However, the
	studies were restricted to interaction only between a structure and
	a finite cavity or a structure and acoustic field of infinite size.
	The system that we have studied has a structure that faces both a
	cavity of finite size and an external field of semi-infinite size.
	We also allow a hole, which can directly interact with the cavity
	as well as the external field. This con"guration, therefore, provides
	two diferent interactions, or communication means. One is the finite
	structure and the other is the hole of finite size. This paper studies
	as to how these two components interact with the other two systems:
	the finite cavity covered by the structure and the hole, and the
	semi-infinite fluid. For simplicity, a two-dimensional and partially
	opened cavity coupled with a membrane and an exterior field was selected.
	The solution has to be found by solving a boundary value problem,
	but this case has to do with the boundaries that have two di!erent
	conditions: one is the membrane and the other is the hole. The solution
	has been found in terms of the modal functions that satisfy the boundary
	conditions of finite cavity, membrane and hole. Non-dimensional coupling
	coefficients are obtained from the solution. The results exhibit
	that the coupling e!ect gives additional peaks and troughs in the
	averaged pressure of the cavity. These peaks and troughs are symmetrically
	arranged with respect to Helmholtz frequency of the cavity. The strong
	coupling occurs at the trough frequencies where the membrane interacts
	actively with the cavity and the exterior field.},

  abstract = {Modal analysis is one of the preeminent methods used by scientists
	and engineers to study vibrating structures. The frequency response
	functions obtained through this method, are, in general, complex-valued.
	There is, however, no agreed-upon interpretation given to the real
	and imaginary parts of these functions, even though it is acknowledged
	that their relative magnitude for different frequencies is related
	to the behaviour of the corresponding modes. A simple model is deduced
	to describe the shape of the spectrum associated with a finite-length
	time-signal. There is very good agreement between results obtained
	using this model and numerical results obtained for, in this case,
	the vibration of a guitar top-plate using finite element methods.
	One interpretation of the relative magnitudes of the real and imaginary
	parts of the frequency response functions is advanced. It is found
	that stationary-wave behaviour is associated with the dominance of
	the real or imaginary part; traveling-wave behaviour, on the other
	hand, occurs when the real and imaginary parts are of the same order
	of magnitude, as long as the scale of damping is large enough and
	resonance peaks in the spectrum are close enough.},

	guitar},
  journal = {Applied Acoustics},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {70},
  pages = {1371-1377},
  abstract = {In this work the effect of two different bridge configurations on
	the vibrations of the top plate of a classical guitar is presented.
	Experimental harmonic analysis and visualization techniques, in addition
	to detailed damped simulations using the finite element method, were
	used to obtain mobility functions and operating deflection shapes
	of a top plate. The mobility functions were obtained in the following
	sequence. First the mobility functions were obtained on the top plate
	without a bridge attached. Then a bridge was glued to the top plate
	and new measurements were made. Finally the already attached bridge
	was cross-cut in situ without detaching it from the top plate, and
	the measurements were repeated. Those specific designs were chosen
	on the grounds of simplicity of construction both experimentally
	and in FEM simulations (no particular preference for those designs
	is implied). The assembly and the specific design of the bridge have
	shown to have considerable influence on the response of the top plate
	regarding the mode shapes above 300 Hz. Depending on the geometry
	of the bridge, its deflections can either be comparable to the maximum
	deflections of the top plate or can have amplitudes so small that
	the bridge effectively creates a nodal zone on the plate vibrations.
	This suggests that the shape, the stiffness, and the mass properties
	of the bridge may play a role in the sound quality of the instrument.},

  volume = {75},
  abstract = {Of humankind's material creations that developed without benefit of
	logical understanding, musical instruments may well be the most complex
	and sophisticated. Although some of the greatest theoretical minds
	of the nineteenth century (such as Helmholtz and Rayleigh) applied
	notable efforts to the study of musical instruments, that period
	lacked the experimental tools to match the virtuosity of its theoreticians;
	so that it was not until the twentieth century, and more particularly,
	the period that overlaps the life of the Acoustical Society of America,
	that the field of Musical Acoustics was truly able to blossom forth.
	Specifically, ASA's first quarter century saw the development of
	sophisticated vacuum-tube technology (powerfully stimulated by World
	War II); the second produced solid-state electronics; and the third
	brought personal computers to every scientist's desk and made digital
	methods part of everyday life. But, unlike the situation in other
	fields, modern electronic methods not only made the physics of musical
	instruments more accessible, they themselves invaded their subject
	matter in the form of electronic music, giving rise to a totally
	new kind of symbiotic relationship. This talk will draw upon the
	annals of JASA to summarize that fascinating period of history.},
