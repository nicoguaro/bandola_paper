# Supplemental files description

- `Drawing_back.dxf`: DXF file of the back plate.
- `Drawing_back.svg`: SVG file of the back plate.
- `Drawing_front.dxf`: DXF file of the front plate.
- `Drawing_front.svg`: SVG file of the back plate.
- `Bandola_body.IGS`: IGS file (CAD) for the enclosed air in the bandola, and air _piston_.
- `Bandola_body.PRT`: Solidworks file (CAD) for the enclosed air in the bandola, and air _piston_.
- `Bandola_body_neck.IGS`: IGS file (CAD) for the enclosed air in the bandola and the plate. This is the real geometry, but it is not used in the analysis.
- `Bandola_body_neck.PRT`: Solidworks file (CAD) for the enclosed air in the bandola and the plate. This is the real geometry, but it is not used in the analysis.
- `Bandola_body_bridge.IGS`: IGS file (CAD) for the enclosed air in the bandola, air _piston_, and neck. This one is used in the harmonic analysis, where the forces are located in the bridge.
- `Bandola_body_bridge.PRT`: Solidworks file (CAD) for the enclosed air in the bandola, air _piston_ and neck. This one is used in the harmonic analysis, where the forces are located in the bridge.
